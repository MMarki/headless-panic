## Tips:
- Use the Arrow Keys to move.
- Bump into monsters to hit them.
- If you get hit, your head falls off and it gets destroyed.
- Equip monster heads to stop the bleeding and get one of their powers.
- Strength potions, Life potions, and Wand Altars are the most important items for tackling the dungeon. There is exactly one of these items (not _one of each_) on every level of the dungeon.
- For Menus: `ESC` to cancel, `ENTER` to confirm 
- Kill the Lich and leave the 15th floor to win.
