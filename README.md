# Headless Panic

Headless Panic is a short (~ 30 minutes long) roguelike where you play as a headless chicken knight. Wear the heads of slain enemies to gain their powers and conquer the dungeon.

- Equip monster heads to stop the bleeding and get one of their powers.
- Strength potions, Life potions, and Altars are the most important items for tackling the dungeon. There is exactly one of these items (not _one of each_) on every level of the dungeon.
- Descend past the 14th floor to win.

- 4 different biomes
- Item-based progression
